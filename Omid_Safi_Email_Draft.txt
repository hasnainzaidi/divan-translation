OUTREACH EMAIL TO DR. OMID SAFI
================================

TO: Omid Safi <omid.safi@duke.edu>
FROM: Hasnain Zaidi <s.hasnainzaidi@gmail.com>
SUBJECT: Seeking Your Guidance: Open-Source Divan-e Kabir Translation Project

---

Dear Dr. Safi,

I am working on an open-source project to create a new English translation of Rumi's complete Divan-e Kabir using large language models. Your work—especially "Radical Love" and your public teaching on the importance of preserving Rumi's Islamic context—has been foundational to our approach.

We are explicitly building the translation system to avoid the "whitewashing" you have critiqued: preserving references to salat, Hajj, Quranic allusions, and Sufi terminology rather than universalizing them into generic spirituality.

Before we begin translating at scale, I would be deeply grateful for your input on our approach. I have attached our terminology glossary, tone guide, and a few sample translations. Does this honor the tradition appropriately? Any guidance would be invaluable.

I understand you are very busy, and I am grateful for any time you might spare—even brief feedback would help us ensure we are on the right path.

With respect and gratitude,

Hasnain Zaidi
