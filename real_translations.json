In the eyes that see beyond sight, You appear every breath! Heaven spins upside down because of You, earth bleeds like an ocean—I won't call You moon, O You who outlast all moons and years! Mountains crack from grief of You—that grief woven into my heart! One drop of blood has found these bounties from Your grace. O support of all chiefs! Count us in that number—You know even heads must have followers trailing behind. You make a master from dust—angels burn with envy! With Your coin, souls turn merchant, wealth trampled underfoot. The one whose wing You are—O his glory, his elevation! The one whose state became this bears beauty marks on his face. Yes, I'm a bad thorn—but thorns bloom for the rose! Even the gold-weigher puts barley on his scales. Thought gave these deeds, dust gave this wealth, Carpet gave these states, states gave these words. World begins in uproar, world ends in earthquake—Love and gratitude with complaint, peace with earthquakes! Shams's seal came as dawn—the royal mark of divine Love's kingdom! The omen of union takes the lead—that Love cast these signs. From 'mercy to the worlds'—see how the dervishes prosper! Robes bright as moon, shawls fragrant as roses. Love is the command 'Be!' and we're just a patch—It's ocean, we're a sip! It brings a hundred proofs while we make arguments. From Love, heaven harmonizes—without Love, stars eclipse! From Love, dal became alif—without Love, alif slouches like dal. Water of life is speech from the knowledge 'from Our presence'—Don't keep your soul empty of it, so it can give birth to deeds! For people of meaning, speech became both general and particular, For people of form, speech became particular and general. If poems were spoken wing by wing, the sea would be pearl—From poetry's rapture, even camels sweetly pull their loads!",

From yours—rebellion, more and less! From His side—blessing upon blessing! From yours—error upon error! From your side—envy, dark imaginings, evil suspicions! From His side—such pulling, such longing eyes, such gifts! Why such longing eyes? So your bitter soul turns sweet! Why such pulling? So you reach the saints! You repent from evil, you cry 'Allah! Allah!' That very moment He pulls you close to deliver you! You fear your sins, you beg for remedy—Why can't you see? That frightening moment is within you! He closes your eyes—you're a chess piece in His hand! Sometimes He rolls you this way, sometimes tosses you in the air! Sometimes He plants lust for silver, gold, and women in you—Sometimes He fills your soul with Mustafa's blazing light! Pulling you toward joy, pulling you toward sorrow—The ship either passes through these whirlpools or breaks apart! Pray so much in secret! Wail through the nights! Until from the dome of seven heavens a Voice reaches your ear! Shu'ayb's cry, his lament, tears like dewdrops—When it passed all limits, Heaven's dawn-call came to him! 'Criminal? I forgive you! Sinner? I pardon you! I'll give you Paradise—now be quiet! Stop this prayer!' He said: 'I want neither this nor that—I want God's face unveiled! Let seven seas turn to fire—I'll dive in to meet You!' If I'm banished from that vision, if my eyes are sealed from Him, I belong in Hell—Paradise means nothing to me! Paradise without His face is Hell itself, my enemy! I burn from this color and scent—where is the splendor of eternal light? They said: 'Weep less! Your sight will fade—Eyes go blind when weeping passes all bounds!' He said: 'If these two eyes will finally see His beauty, Every part of me becomes an eye—why fear blindness?' And if this eye stays forever deprived, Let that sight go blind that's unworthy of the Friend! Every human sacrifices everything for their beloved—One's beloved is a sack of blood, another's is Shams of Light! Everyone chose their beloved to match themselves, good or bad—We grudge ourselves for dying in the 'No' of 'There is no god but God'! A man joined Bayazid on the road one day—Bayazid asked: 'What's your trade, you fraud?' 'I sell donkeys,' he said. 'Go!' said Bayazid, 'O Lord, kill his donkey so he can serve You!'",
